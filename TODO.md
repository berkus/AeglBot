   - actix / riker could be used for structuring the bot as independent entities
    1. supervisor to restart failing telegram connection
       - see telegram-event-bot for structure idea
       - telecord uses a simplistic approach
    2. actix-diesel thingie to run blocking diesel in a separate actor
       - https://github.com/actix/examples/blob/f8e3570bd16bcf816070af20f210ce1b4f2fca69/diesel/src/main.rs#L64-L70
    3. futures-cpupool as a very primitive wrapper
       - https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/399
    4. tokio threadpool blocking tasks
       - https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/317
    5. bb8 as diesel pool
       - could this help?
    6. Marat promised actix-telegram crate on 2018-09-12 in @rustlang_ru chat:
        https://github.com/jeizsm/actix-telegram/blob/autogenerated_types/examples/polling.rs
        ✔ it's now available @done (18-09-22 19:41)
