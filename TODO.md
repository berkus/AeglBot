`Impl`s for the SeaORM entities:

```rust
// src/entity/pet.rs

// Model - for views and other state/display things
impl Model {
    pub fn display_name(&self) -> String {
        format!("Pet: {} (ID: {})", self.name, self.id)
    }
}

use sea_orm::{DatabaseConnection, EntityTrait, QueryFilter, ColumnTrait};

// Entity - for reading data from DB
impl Entity {
    pub async fn find_by_name(
        db: &DatabaseConnection,
        name: &str,
    ) -> sea_orm::Result<Option<Model>> {
        Entity::find()
            .filter(Column::Name.eq(name))
            .one(db)
            .await
    }
}

// ActiveModel - for changing data in the DB
impl ActiveModel {
    pub fn set_name(&mut self, name: String) {
        self.name = sea_orm::ActiveValue::Set(name);
    }
}
```


- [ ] Add waiting-list for activities.

- [ ] Mark past WF events with "(ended) " prefix.
- [ ] HANDLE ERRORS
- [x] match guardian- and telegram-names case-insensitive (use filter(`.ilike`(match))) @done (19-05-21 22:09)
   - [ ] GUARDIAN_ID could be int, telegram name or psn name
- [ ] implement support for sub-commands
   - [ ] commands may register sub-commands using the same matcher interface
- [x] Track weekly raids cycle automatically,
   - [ ] disallow creating weekly raids when they're inactive
   - [ ] suggest next closest week when it's active
- [ ] Inline buttons to join or leave raid
- [ ] Interactive calendar + clock picker to plan raids
   - [ ] this may require full actor framework already to track states properly
     - [ ] actor per user creating raid?
- [x] Rewrite with actors, self-healing and other nice-to-have things.
   - actix / riker could be used for structuring the bot as independent entities
    1. supervisor to restart failing telegram connection
       - see telegram-event-bot for structure idea
       - telecord uses a simplistic approach
    3. futures-cpupool as a very primitive wrapper

    6. Marat promised actix-telegram crate on 2018-09-12 in @rustlang_ru chat:
        https://github.com/jeizsm/actix-telegram/blob/autogenerated_types/examples/polling.rs
        âœ” it's now available @done (18-09-22 19:41)
